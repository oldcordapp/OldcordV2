# OldcordV2
Current code for OldCord 2015 and whatnot, instructions on how to setup an instance coming soon. Rewrite also coming soon, yucky code.
2016, 2017 support is planned but currently a work in progress!!!
Fun fact: this is a rewrite of the original code already, in the original code 2016 was supported but not finished.
# Dont ask for WebRTC as it most likely will never be finished, my brain too small for that
